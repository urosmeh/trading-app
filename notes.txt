Packages installed:
- react-router: for handling different pages based on url & params
- recharts: for displaying charts
- zod: data validation
- react-hook-form: form validation
- react-query: synchronizing server-side state management library
- react-loader-spinner: loading spinner
- classnames: easier className merging.

In the task description for this test, it was not specified for the app to include asset search, but I added it to improve
user experience and to make app easier to test and interactable.
As part of that, I also added "Back to search" link to navbar (if user is not on the home page).

I only wrote some tests, not for all components.

It was unclear in task description how navbar funds should be shown, so I display all funds user has.
In example, if user buys 1 eth and 0.01 btc it will show both in navbar. It is not optimized for showing a lot of different funds.

Real-time price chart:
- refetching data every 10 seconds (changes may not be visible as I think CoinCap api doesn't change historical prices as often.
- rate also refetches every 10 seconds.

Performance optimization is done by caching data with react-query and using useCallback and memo. LazyLoading could be added as well, if app was bigger.
Debounced input is also implemented.

Error handling is handled by react-query as well (api). in case of error, an ErrorRetry component will be rendered allowing user to retry api call.
